WARNING!

We use the same tables for custom and estimate planning for Ghantt charts as well as custom and user plannings for Roadmaps

Ghantt chart:
* In custom planning we use task_name
* In estimate planning we use estimate_line_id to take line caption

Roadmap:
* In custom planning we use task_group_name
* In user planning we use user_id to take user's name
